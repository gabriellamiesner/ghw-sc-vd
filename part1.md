# ghw - smart contract vulnerability detection part one

## check in w/ mlh 
- bit.ly/scvd1

## goal: system that uses machine learning (ML) to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts
- Components: 
    - Data Collection: Gather a dataset of smart contracts with known vulnerabilities
        - etherscan contract API 
        - https://etherscan.io/apis
        - to do: create an etherscan api account, get an api key, start pulling etherscan data from the api, clean data so we have what we need for the ML vulnerability detection model 
    - Machine Learning Model: Train a model to identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code
